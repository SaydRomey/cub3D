cub3d - todo

remove make bonus constraints and targets?
(or set make all to make bonus)?

cleanup branches
make sure main branch is clean:
only necessary code,
proper default eval pic
proper map and textures

keep rendu with make and make bonus, different readme?

add maze map?


fix makefile:
organise in sub makefiles,

make info:
description, rules, dependencies, controls, etc.

..subtitle for who did what...

oroy:
raycaster engine,
collisions,
elevator and segworld logic,
door and sprite animation,
in game controls menu,
texture choice and design

cdumais:
cubfile parsing and validation,
multi map logic,
player controls and events system,
minimap,
pixel drawing functions,
vxf (shadow)

Requirements:
(project basic requirements...)

Cubfile Details

details on .cub file requirements to be valid...
.cub suffix, contain all valid info:

(any order for following elements)
paths to textures (limit of one per direction),
(texture rules?limits?)
floor ceiling color rules.

(map element must be last in cub file)
map part rules
symbols and meaning

(example of a valid cub file)

examples of invalid cubfiles:
(link to invalid map example dir)

details on how to use custom map and textures...
links to get/generate texture, dimension rules (if any)

...

Bonus:
details on bonuses in pdf...

Extras:

- optional floor and ceiling textures

- Player speedup on left shift press

- texture rendering toggle (texture or base color)

- Interaction mode on mouse right click
(disable mouse turning controls, enable cursor to interact with elevator buttons)

- Elevator:
implementation of elevator with automatic doors that open on player's proximity instead of regular doors.
Green buttons appear when inside the elevator.
The elevator goes up and down by clicking the buttons in interactive mode (mouse right click).
On button click, the door closes and opens on the next level.


- Multimaps implementation:
(insert example of launching executable with multiple arguments)
requires an elevator in the .cub file to go to the next level in executable arguments...
(image of closeup of an elevator in cub file)
(rules for valid elevator: 1 per level, 3 walls, one open side)

symbol isna '3',
must he bordered by exactly 3 symbols '1' (walls) and one symbol '0' (walkable space)



- segworld:
edge-case for traveling from level with elevator to level without elevator:
"segworld" hidden level becomes destination (and blocks following levels)
with more extras:
extracting of student evaluating the project on school Mac (extraction of student picture in specific path), default image instead if not found
(this is handled in the makefile during compilation).
animated sprites.(blue flames on the floor, randomized positions, do not spawn near the door).
floor and ceiling glitchy rendering (toggle option, stops rerendering floor and ceiling).
conditions: toggle texture rendering to off
(example short clip)

- Minimap:
minimap is more complex than required:
two modes:
1. centered tile based.

2. Top right radar,
Round with colored border, with player icon centered in a triangular icon and pointing the player's facing direction.

*extras available in both modes*:

- highlighting tile with player's position (optional).

- Dynamic minimap colors 

(walkable space will either be an average color of the floor texture (if present in cubfile), 
or a default color.)

(wall space will be an average color of each wall texture's average color )

(player icon will be inverted color from the wallable tile color)

- Secondary simplified raycaster to simulate field of view in minimap displaying colored rays from the player's position.
(separate from the main raycaster, so values are approximated and modifiable via the macros in .h)

- extra only in radar mode:
Interference effect when inside an elevator (simulates radio interference with random pixel noise)

- ui menu for controls with toggleable display (partial or full display)


.....

Future Additions and ideas:

Interactive mode
Add other interactions (ui interaction?)

menus

starting menu:
settings sub menu (same as in game menu)
save/load?
level selector?

...

map maker (in minimalist ui, drawn with mouse)
wall texture selector,
floor ceiling color wheel?
(maybe automate launching executable with created map?)
*check if already exists*
music in the elevator

...

minimap:

ft_swap tile colors toggle option?

rotating minimap and player icon facing up

instead of rendering minimap outside walkable area as black, stop the minimap from rendering outside and instead temporarily stop centering player icon until he goes to a place where he can be centered again

zooming feature

minimap movable with mouse?

clicking ont tile in radar shows number of steps to do to get to it

minimap settings:
toggle player icon,
invert tile colors,

isometric mimimap

...

vfx:
optimize shadow
flashlight effect? (center of screen unaffected by shadow when toggled on)

fog and floor fog

parallax sky effect (maybe in "roofworld", when on last level and seesky effect is toggled..

or maybe find a eay to render through small sections of a window on wall texture ?
