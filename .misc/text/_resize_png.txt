$> sudo apt-get install imagemagick

- Resize a png

$> convert original.png -resize 64x64 resized.png

Scales the image to fit within the 64x64 box
while maintaining the aspect ratio.
If the aspect ratio of the original image is different from the 64x64 dimensions,
the output image may not cover the entire 64x64 pixel area to avoid stretching the image


If we specifically want the image to be exactly 64x64 pixels
and are okay with the image being stretched or squashed,
we can force the resize without preserving the aspect ratio
by using the following command instead:

$> convert original.png -resize 64x64\! resized.png

The \! at the end of the resize parameter
instructs ImageMagick to ignore the aspect ratio.

- Add a background color

$> convert original.png -background 'YourColor' -flatten resized.png

If we want the background to be blue,
we would use -background 'blue'.
If we're using a hex color code,
it would look something like -background '#RRGGBB'

** '-flatten' removes transparency and applies the background color
